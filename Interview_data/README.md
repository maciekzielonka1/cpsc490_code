# Interview_data folder

This folder contains the interviews used for this project, taken from the data gathered in Brian Scassellati and Iolanda Leite's Comparing Models of Disengagement in Individual and Group Interactions study. 
The folder in this repository does not contain all the interviews used, only a portion for the sake of demonstration. For access to the rest of the data, please contact Scaz Lab at Yale or Maciej Zielonka at maciekzielonka1@gmail.com
